## Chatgpt made a gameplay loop to run the game, involving:
## - launching window
## - showing start button
## - randomly selecting colors
## - deciding whether or not the actual colors match the player's colors
## - continue the game if the player is right
## - showing game over screen if the player is wrong
## After the game ends, an updated bar chart and box plot is shown to the user.
